        "In class you have learned about the protocols for exchanging classical and quantum units of information. BB84 is one such protocol. BB84 is a protocol proposed by Charles Bennet and Gilles Brassard in 1984. It was introduced for securely generating random bitstrings, which can then be used to encrypt information to securely share it between parties. In this task we are going to look at this protocol, and how its behavior changes as we introduce noise to its operation."

In a noiseless communication channel, if there is noise between the sender and recieverm then the noise is generated by an unwanted observer. Although this relationship is not very evident from the simulated runs shown above, theoretically, the presence of an observer should induce more noise into the cimmunication channle than if the unwanted observer was absent."
